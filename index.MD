# Luigi Impossible (in development)

## Description: 
A Luigi platformer game written in C#. The goal of the game is simple, make it to the end of the level. The twist is, it's almost 
impossible. With hidden traps and enemies lurking to stop the player at every turn. 

## About Development:
The game was written solely in C# using GDI+ and no Unity for the sole purpose of acquainting myself to the syntax and libraries of C#.
At this moment in time, the game is not complete, but I have gone ahead and shared what has been accomplished thus far. The cover menu was
drawn using the Wacom drawing pad and Clip Art Studio. I plan to complete to full game at a later date.
